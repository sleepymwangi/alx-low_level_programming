Like arrays, a Linked List is a linear data structure. Unlike arrays, linked list elements are not stored at a contiguous location; the elements are linked using pointers. They include a series of connected nodes. Here, each node stores the data and the address of the next node.

Applications of Linked Lists
● Linked Lists can be used to implement useful data structures like stacks and queues. 

● Linked Lists can be used to implement hash tables, each bucket of the hash table can be a linked list. 

● Linked Lists can be used to implement graphs (Adjacency List representation of graph). 

● Linked Lists can be used in a refined way in implementing different file systems in one form or another.
